A simple Java applications to create `.bat` files when Command Prompt is disabled or doesn't work.
_ Made because PowerShell is an annoying (but powerful) application.

Simply add in the command you want to run in Command Prompt and it will create a file in the current directory called `output.bat`. Run that file and you will see the output of the command; `pause` is automatically added to the end so the window doesn't close after running the command.

## Future Features (Maybe)
* Newline button
* The program will run the `.bat` file automatically.
  * It will delete it once it's done. I'll add this as a feature if it's not too hard to implement.
